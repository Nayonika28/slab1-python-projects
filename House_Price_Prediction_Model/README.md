# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project is part of the Python Internship (Slab 1 – Task 2). It uses the Boston Housing dataset to build a simple linear regression model for predicting house prices.

---

## 📊 Dataset Used:
- Dataset: `Boston Housing Dataset`
- Loaded directly from `scikit-learn.datasets`

---

## 🧪 Tasks Performed:
- Loaded the dataset using `fetch_openml()`
- Explored features and data types
- Visualized correlations using a heatmap
- Trained a Linear Regression model
- Evaluated the model using MSE and R² Score
- Plotted actual vs predicted values

---

## 🔍 Key Observations:
- Strong correlation observed between `RM` (number of rooms) and house price
- The model gives reasonably good predictions for price
- Scatter plot helps visualize how well predictions fit the actual values

---

## 🛠️ Libraries Used:
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

---

✅ This project is one of three tasks submitted for **Slab 1** of the internship.
